## 5. PR #8803: fix(docker): do not run the Zebra nodes with the root user
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/8803
- **Merged**: 2024-08-27T11:55:24Z
- **Created**: 2024-08-26T20:12:21Z
- **Labels**: A-devops, C-security, P-High üî•

## 7. PR #8796: ref(docker): use cache mounts for build cache
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/8796
- **Merged**: 2024-09-05T13:29:22Z
- **Created**: 2024-08-22T12:07:46Z
- **Labels**: A-devops, C-enhancement, I-heavy, P-Low ‚ùÑÔ∏è
- **Summary**: Replaces external tools like cargo-chef with Docker cache mounts for Rust builds. Results in ~36% build time improvement (4m30s reduction from 13 minutes to 8.5 minutes).
