Motivation\\n\\nWe have been using multiple approaches to locate and retrieve cached states in GCP. However, this has made it difficult to reuse the same methods across new workflows or different scenarios.\\n\\nTo address this, we have streamlined the process to make it more reusable in other contexts. This change will support deploying instances from both the `main` branch and `release`, simplifying future implementations and speeding up the process.\\n\\n### Specifications & References\\n\\nThis is the ground work for:\\n- https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/6894\\n\\n## Solution\\n- Use a single bash script (`gcp-get-cached-disks.sh`) to get cached states names and availability\\n- Move script logic from `sub-find-cached-disks.yml` to `gcp-get-cached-disks.sh` and adapt `sub-find-cached-disks.yml` to allow to output available disks and disks names.\\n- Simplify parameters usage in `sub-deploy-integration-tests-gcp.yml` and convert the `Find ${{ inputs.test_id }} cached state disk` step into an independent job, to be able to use the `sub-find-cached-disks.yml` reusable workflow\\n- Remove repetition in `sub-ci-integration-tests-gcp.yml`\\n- Allow sync tests to use the `ZEBRA_CACHED_STATE_DIR` as the cache directory, if specified\\n- Update the `entrypoint.sh` to reflect this change\\n- Add the `ZEBRA_CACHED_STATE_DIR` variable to the missing tests in `sub-ci-integration-tests-gcp.yml`, and remove extra parameters to call reusable workflows.\\n\\n### Tests\\n\\nAll test should find their respective cached states and run sucessfully\\n\\n### Follow-up Work\\n\\n- https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/6894\\n- https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/infra/issues/15\\n\\n### PR Author Checklist\\n\\n<!-- If you are the author of the PR, check the boxes below before making the PR\\nready for review. -->\\n\\n- [x] The PR name will make sense to users.\\n- [x] The PR provides a CHANGELOG summary.\\n- [x] The solution is tested.\\n- [x] The documentation is up to date.\\n- [x] The PR has a priority label.\\n\\n### PR Reviewer Checklist\\n\\n<!-- If you are a reviewer of the PR, check the boxes below before approving it. -->\\n\\n- [ ] The PR Author checklist is complete.\\n- [ ] The PR resolves the issue.\\n\\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/8868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/8868/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1.0}]}'''
